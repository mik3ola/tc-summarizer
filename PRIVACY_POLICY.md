# Privacy Policy for TermsDigest

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

TermsDigest ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

### Free Tier (Using Your Own API Key)

- **No data collection**: When you use your own OpenAI API key, all processing happens locally in your browser or directly between your browser and OpenAI's servers.
- **Local storage only**: We store your preferences (API key, settings) locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This data never leaves your device.
- **Cache**: Summaries are cached locally in your browser for 30 days to improve performance and reduce API costs. This cache is stored on your device only.

### Subscriber Tier (Using Our Backend)

- **Text content**: When you request a summary, the text content of the legal document is sent to our backend for processing. This text is:
  - Used only to generate the summary
  - **Never stored permanently**
  - Deleted immediately after processing
- **Account information**: If you create an account, we collect:
  - Email address (for account management and subscription)
  - Subscription status and usage statistics
- **Usage statistics**: We track the number of summaries you've used (for quota enforcement). We do not track:
  - Which websites you visit
  - Which specific documents you summarize
  - The content of your summaries

## How We Use Your Information

- **To provide the service**: Generate summaries of legal documents
- **To manage subscriptions**: Process payments and manage your account
- **To enforce quotas**: Track usage against your subscription tier
- **To improve the service**: Aggregate, anonymized usage statistics (e.g., total summaries processed)

## Data Sharing

- **OpenAI**: If you use your own API key, text is sent directly to OpenAI. Their privacy policy applies: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
- **Stripe**: Payment information is processed by Stripe. Their privacy policy applies: https://stripe.com/privacy
- **Supabase**: Our backend uses Supabase for authentication and database. Their privacy policy applies: https://supabase.com/privacy
- **No third-party tracking**: We do not use analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local storage**: Your API key and preferences are encrypted by Chrome's storage API
- **Backend storage**: 
  - Text content is never stored permanently
  - Account information is stored securely in Supabase (encrypted at rest)
  - Usage statistics are stored in our database (anonymized)
- **Security measures**: We use industry-standard security practices including HTTPS, encrypted storage, and secure authentication

## Your Rights
