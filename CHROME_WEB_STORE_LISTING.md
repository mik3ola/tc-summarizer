TermsDigest is a Chrome extension that uses AI to summarize legal documents (Terms of Service, Privacy Policies, Refund Policies) when you hover over them. No more reading through pages of legal jargon—get the key information in seconds.

✨ Key Features:

🖱️ Hover to Summarize
Just hover over any Terms, Privacy Policy, or Refund Policy link. After a brief moment, a summary appears with the most important information.

🎯 Highlights What Matters
Our AI extracts and highlights:
• Costs and renewal terms
• Cancellation and refund policies
• Liability and dispute resolution
• Privacy and data usage
• Red flags and concerning clauses
• Supporting quotes from the document

⚡ Smart Caching
Summaries are cached for 30 days, so you won't waste time or API credits re-summarizing the same documents.

🔒 Privacy First
• Free tier: Use your own OpenAI API key (data stays local)
• Pro tier: Text is processed but never stored permanently

## Privacy Practices

### Single Purpose

### Host Permissions

**Yes** - We request access to all URLs because:
- Legal documents appear on websites across the entire internet
- We cannot predict which domains users will visit
- The extension only processes content when users explicitly hover over legal links

See `PERMISSIONS_JUSTIFICATION.md` for detailed explanation.

### User Data

**Yes** - We collect:
- Account information (email, subscription status) - for account management
- Usage statistics (summary count) - for quota enforcement
- Text content (temporary) - sent to backend for summarization, never stored
